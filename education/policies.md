# Policies
The cover items as risk, a policy which is a legal agreement between the insured and the insurer, outlines the scope and extent of the restoration.  Policies have a lifecycle and terminology, so in this section, we will dive into the details.


# Overview
The policy, being a legal document, is the heard of the w3if ecosystem.  We need to allow a Product to be added to the policy, the asset owner to accepts the terms and conditions of the Product.  We then need the Underwriting process to allocate the appropriate funding for the policy coverages.  

In addition, the Policy establishes the payment terms, the cancellation terms and the terms for disagreement between the parties.
