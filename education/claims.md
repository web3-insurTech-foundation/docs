# Claims

This section of documentation applies to claims, what are they, how do they work, how do we need to treat them from a technology and social perspective.

# Overview
The core of insurance comes down to the claim.  This is where the insured is "made whole" by the insurer and their asset (property) is restored as best possible to pre event status.   Clearly its not possible to restore to 100% pre event status, however, all good faith attempts are made to "make whole".

As you can see from the state diagram, there is a long process to make whole.  While claims follow the same process, its clear, depending on the asset, this can take days to weeks to years.
