# Introduction
Welcome to Part III of our exploration of the Know Your Client & Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) regulation and its application to the blockchain financial ecosystem. Thank you for your comments, especially about why KYC/AML is essential to an organization's success and society's goals of prosperity and equity.

We now get to the core of this topic. Given its daunting challenge, this article is merely the beginning of the conversation—the prickly and evergreen task of Identity Verification. Prickly, as we now talk about implementation, how do we merge the distributed and trustless world with centralized regulatory and business guardrails?  Furthermore, like much of our world, it is evergreen in that the solution will continue to evolve as new technology, standards, and threats emerge.  This is the most critical aspect of the solution approach; the implementation must be open to change, evolve at an accelerating speed, and accept replacement.  The stated goal does not change; we must achieve Identity and a verification system for a distributed and trustless universe.

Identity verification is a multipart process.  At a high level, a customer provides documentation stating their identity.  Here is my Driver’s License.  Secondly, the authenticity of the documentation is verified.  Confirm the Driver’s License has not been altered; is it authentic?  We inspect watermarks and other tamper-proof security features in today's physical world.  Third, the pedigree of the document is verified.  The Driver’s License is from the State of Florida. Is this a Florida Driver’s License?  We inspect the government (or issuing authority) seal/stamp and compare it to known validated seals/stamps.  Depending on the nature of the KYC/AML due diligence requirement, the pedigree is further ratified by contacting the issuing authority and confirming the authenticity and validity of the document provided.

So, with this rudimentary model of Identity Verification, we now look to the blockchain world for parity.  The best starting point is to look at the internet today.  You are reading this article in a browser running on a computer connected to a series of public networks from a server you have never seen from an organization you barely know.  Yet, somehow, you trust all these components and actors deliver accurate, authentic, and original content.  

Do you see the light?  This is the path for Web3.  

The internet has solved the majority of these challenges already, such concepts as Secure Sockets (think pipelines for data to move), Certificates (identity documentation - driver’s licenses), Certificate Authorities (the issuing authority - State of Florida from the above example), Certificate Chains[1[ (how do we distribute the authority to issue Certificates to enable mass scaling - the DMV), Digital Fingerprints (encryption algorithms - like your signature on your driver’s license).  

The layers are many, and the details are complex, but you understand how we have a proven, scalable methodology to follow or a solid starting point for our evergreen journey.

Now that we have an implementation pattern, what do we need to verify? What is Identity? 

In the blockchain world, identity extends beyond people's identity; we imply the identity of any physical object and any digital object (content).  For life identity (human, animal, bacteria), we would look at DNA, with almost every living entity possessing unique DNA. Although there are exceptions, in all fairness, DNA is considered a key component of identity.  Therefore, we expand our thought of identity to more of a composition of identifying traits: DNA, Fingerprints, voice, eyes, and faces.  These are considered mostly immutable, although they, too, change over time. The package of these traits in a time-scoped frame uniquely identifies an entity.  For digital content, we have encryption technology that determines its Fingerprints and validates its composition and authenticity.

Going back to our reference implementation, if an entity's traits are measured, the measurement must be certified and authenticated by an issuing authority.  In a concrete example, your DNA.  Some companies will take your tissue sample, run it through a certified machine and produce a certified DNA report.  To further authenticate the process, the tissue sampling procedure has certification processes; you provide your official identity, which is conducted via an accredited process with signatures to prove the sample's pedigree.  While some people have their DNA analyzed for personal reasons, this process is more on the honor system.  However, strict certification and process control are necessary for more elevated roles.

Stay with me; this is getting long, but I promise we will get to the good stuff soon.

1. **Identification and Verification:** Financial institutions must establish procedures to accurately identify and verify the identities of their clients. This includes obtaining information such as name, address, date of birth, and official identification documents like passports or driver's licenses.
