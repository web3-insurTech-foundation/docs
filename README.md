# Welcome to our documentation
This repo is solely here for additional documentation that does not fit directly into one of our working groups, a general catch all.

The feedback from the commmunity is greater diversity in documents and organization, so we will let this one evolve.  
Please follow the standards as set forth by the w3if foundation, as outlined on our mission page, around core values
We welcome you participation and look forward to really changing the world
