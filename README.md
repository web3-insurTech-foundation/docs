# Welcome to our documentation
This repo is solely here for additional documentation that does not fit directly into one of our working groups, a general catch all.

The feedback from the commmunity is greater diversity in documents and organization, so we will let this one evolve.  
Please follow the standards as set forth by the w3if foundation, as outlined on our mission page, around core values
We welcome you participation and look forward to really changing the world

# Table of Contents
This repo contains the following
1. Whitepaper - what is it we are trying to achieve here?
2. Moving Us Forward - how do we engage our society?
3. Glossary - there are many terms, we should align
4. Timelines & Milestones - loose scheduling and accomplishments

If you would like to contribute more, please, we welcome your contributions.

The best way to contribute is to follow the poen source model, create a branch, commit and make a pull request.  Our moderators are most always around to review and discuss. There are no bad ideas, we are simply trying to stop bad actors from contaminating our work (regrettably)

So, please, jump in, we know you have something to say

Refresh for 11/23
