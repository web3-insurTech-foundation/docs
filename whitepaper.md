# web3 InsurTech Foundation
Our whitepaper sets the direction and tone for our project.  In a company, we would have a Vision and Mission statement, but as we want to be less formal, we wrap these concepts along with pseudo project plan into a Whitepaper.

This document outlines where we want to be, what we want to achieve, how we are going to achieve it and the benefits to us all when we arrive.

# About Us
To get started, we need to understand us.

We are your family, neighbors, friends, co-workers, contractors, doctors, mechanics.  We are society, we are all connected.  We are all impacted by insurance, we pay insurance premiums and in unfortunate and stressful situations we receive insurance payments to help reduce the impact of the event.

# Our Mission
We seek to make the world a more equitable place, and through our efforts in streamlining insurance and helping to solve a societal problem, we will make everyone's life better.

# Why Insurance?
Our need for safety and surety is evolutionary, from the first fires at night to keep watch against predators to clothing to keep ourselves warm in winter, it is the human condition to move and extend beyond our natural limits.  It is only through the insurance of clothing, warmth, protection, education and innovation can we achieve more.

Insurance makes this happen.

Insurance too, however, has become large and complicated.  Not because it wants to, but because it is forced to.  Therefore, to help establish order and reduce the complexity, we need to address the fundamental challenges therein.

At its core, its 400 years old, well at least for the Western Civilization version.  Fundamentally, it hasn't changed much in those 400 years, it is still a process of matching risk and return and throwing the dice to Fate.
